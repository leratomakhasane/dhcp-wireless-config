# dhcp-wireless-config
A Cisco Packet Tracer lab showing how to configure DHCP on a wireless router to automatically assign IPs to multiple clients. Demonstrates skills in IP addressing, DHCP setup, router management, and connectivity testingâ€”key for network administration, SOC analysis, and cybersecurity roles.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To configure a wireless router in CISCO Packet Tracer to automatically assign IP addressess to multiple connected PCs using DHCP. This project demonstrates understanding of **network topology setup**, **DHCP configuration**, **IP addressing**, and **connectivity verification**.
