# dhcp-wireless-config
A Cisco Packet Tracer lab showing how to configure DHCP on a wireless router to automatically assign IPs to multiple clients. Demonstrates skills in IP addressing, DHCP setup, router management, and connectivity testingâ€”key for network administration, SOC analysis, and cybersecurity roles.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To configure a wireless router in CISCO Packet Tracer to automatically assign IP addressess to multiple connected PCs using DHCP. This project demonstrates understanding of **network topology setup**, **DHCP configuration**, **IP addressing**, and **connectivity verification**.
- Connect 3 PCs to a wireless router
- Change the DHCP setting to a specific network range
- Configure the clients to obtain their address via DHCP
<br>

## ðŸ§  Skills Learned
- Configuring DHCP on a wireless router
- Understanding IP addressing and default gateways
- Setting and modifying DHCP ranges and scopes
- Connecting end devices in a small LAN topology
- Verifying IP configurations using `ipconfig` and `ping`
- Network troubleshooting in CISCO Packet Tracer
<br>

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- CISCO Packet Tracer (network simulation)
- Command prompt (network testing)
- Web browser router GUI (router setup and DHCP configuration)
<br>

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed
Scenario
A home user wants to use a wireless router to connect 3 PCs. All 3 PCs should obtain their address automatically from the wireless router.

**Part 1: Setting up the network topology**
Add three generic PCs
Connect each PC to an Ethernet port to the wireless router using straight-through cables.
