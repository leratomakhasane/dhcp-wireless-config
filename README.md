# dhcp-wireless-config
A Cisco Packet Tracer lab showing how to configure DHCP on a wireless router to automatically assign IPs to multiple clients. Demonstrates skills in IP addressing, DHCP setup, router management, and connectivity testingâ€”key for network administration, SOC analysis, and cybersecurity roles.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To configure a wireless router in CISCO Packet Tracer to automatically assign IP addressess to multiple connected PCs using DHCP. This project demonstrates understanding of **network topology setup**, **DHCP configuration**, **IP addressing**, and **connectivity verification**.
- Connect 3 PCs to a wireless router
- Change the DHCP setting to a specific network range
- Configure the clients to obtain their address via DHCP
<br>

## ðŸ§  Skills Learned
- Configuring DHCP on a wireless router
- Understanding IP addressing and default gateways
- Setting and modifying DHCP ranges and scopes
- Connecting end devices in a small LAN topology
- Verifying IP configurations using `ipconfig` and `ping`
- Network troubleshooting in CISCO Packet Tracer
<br>

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- CISCO Packet Tracer (network simulation)
- Command prompt (network testing)
- Web browser router GUI (router setup and DHCP configuration)
<br>

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed
Scenario
A home user wants to use a wireless router to connect 3 PCs. All 3 PCs should obtain their address automatically from the wireless router.

**Part 1: Setting up the network topology**
1. Add three generic PCs
2. Connect each PC to an Ethernet port to the wireless router using straight-through cables.

<br>

**Part 2: Observe the default DHCP settings**
1. After the amber lights have turned green, click **PC0**. Click the **Desktop** tab. Select **IP Configuration**. Select **DHCP** to receive an IP address from **DHCP Enabled Router**.

Record the IP address of the default gateway
`192.168.0.1`


2. Close the IP Configuration window.
3. Open a Web Browser.
4. Enter the IP address of the default gateway recorded earlier into the URL field. When prompted, enter the username admin and password admin.

5. Scroll through the Basic Setup page to view default settings, including the default IP address of the wireless router.

6. Notice that DHCP is enabled, the starting address of the DHCP range and the range of addresses available to clients.
